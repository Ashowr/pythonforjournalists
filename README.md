**About the Course**
What is the course about; who is it for; and what will you learn? 

The Python for Journalists course xxx four modules: 

1. Set up
This module revolves around installing the right tools on your laptop. To follow along in the coming modules, you'll need Python 3, and several Python libraries like Requests, Jupyter Notebooks, and BeautifulSoup installed. I recommend installing all of this software in one go, using the [Anaconda distribution](https://anaconda.org/).
